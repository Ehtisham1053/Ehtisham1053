## 🌟 About Me
I’m a **Data Scientist & ML Engineer** with hands-on experience building end-to-end data solutions — from EDA and feature engineering to model development, validation and production deployment. I design and optimise ML/DL models (regression, classification, forecasting, CNNs, RNNs), work with NLP & transformer-based LLMs, and build web APIs with **Flask** to ship production-ready systems. I enjoy turning messy data into actionable insights and automating pipelines that deliver business impact.
